TridentSDK
=========

The TridentSDK is a new development API which can be used to develop plugins for the popular game Minecraft. This SDK has a few things that its' older sisters do not. 

- Evades Mojangs EULA
- Adds more features as requested by the community
- Replaces the Bukkit Project.
- Does not use Mojangs code.


This has been created by a team of dedicated and hardworking people that want nothing more than creating a better future for Minecraft develeopers.
